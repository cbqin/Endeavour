# How to design a project that will actually get companies interested

## 0. Come up with your project idea

- Map your project to your ideal jobs
- Make it useful and unique
- Constrain your resources (compute,time and momey)
- Define your metrics

## 1. Collect your own data

- Greate data sources
  - APIs (e.g.https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
  - Web scraping
  - Access to information requests,emailing companies/people
- Keep track of the challenges you run into

## 2. Clean + explore your data

- Keep your objectives in mind
- Explore = anything that gives you high-level insights
  - This can include modelling
-How can I make money off this data? What could go wrong?

## 3. Train & optimize your models

- Don't spend too long here, because everyone else will
- Simple is better
- Interpret your model
- Model selection is important, but not as important as you think

## 4. Evaluate your model

- What's your metric?
- What's your win condition?
- Do you need to do more?
- Can you measure/estimate the value you created somehow?

## 5. Show off your work to the world
